# CLAIM 2020

I'm dropping here a slide deck; summerizing the project I was involved in, as a data anlalyst and web developer, for the National Insitute of Marine technologies of Tunisia, INSTM, CLIAM 2020 Porject.

The research team has been collecting, for over 5 years, very abundant and important data about medietterian surface waters (salinity, turbidity, temeprature,..).
My role was to build a dynamic process to visualize these parameters in a scientifically exploitable manner, and to facilitate its exploration and use for the research team.

I was intrusted with these missions:
- Collecting data, automating data integration and standardizing the pre-treatments and quality controls
- Documenting and insuring the continuity of the processes (using batch files)
- Building a dynamic web application to facilitate data querying and representation in different forms and graphics
- Building an admin board that allowed the data export/import and sending data to international communities

I used Python language, Django Framework, JavaScript (Leaflet, Highcharts), PostgreSQL database and Jupyter notebook in this project.

Several results were promising and promised to be included in scientific articles ( the results of data classification (K-means algorithm) , time series creation process and results, applied data quality standards etc..)
